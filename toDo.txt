=> Ask the user for the number they want to convert from base 10.
=> Ask the user for the base they want to convert to.
=> Get the number line for the requested base.
=> Calculate the highest exponent that can fit fully into the base 10 number - loop that counts up until the number doesn't fit any more? - add all the numbers to a list/dictionary?
=> Declare the length of the string in the requested base?
=> For each exponent (working backwards) check if the base 10 number fits & how many times. Subtract the resulting number from base 10, and check that against the next number.
	If the number fits, check the number line for the requested base for the correct number/letter to add to the requested base string.
	If the number doesn't fit, immediately move to checking the next number and add a 0 to the requested base string (the output).
